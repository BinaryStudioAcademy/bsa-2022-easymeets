# BSA 2022 | .NET | EasyMeets

EasyMeets is is a scheduling platform that makes it easier to track users' availability and schedule meetings with internal teams and external people. It's responsible for tracking and managing user's calendars, sharing their availability, automatic event creation, and reminder sending.

**Technologies:**

Backend:

- Platform: .NET 6
- Network: REST, SignalR, RabbitMQ
- Database: MS SQL Server, Entity Framework Core
- Cloud: Azure
- Other: JWT, Firebase, Docker

Frontend:

- Angular
- HTML5/CSS3/SASS

## Building sources

By default, apps run on the following ports:

| Application            | Port |
| ---------------------- | ---- |
| EasyMeets.**Core**     | 5050 |
| EasyMeets.**Notifier** | 5070 |
| RabbitMQ               | 5672 |

_Tip: If you want to connect to the specific service outside of docker, then use "localhost" as a service name, but if both services are inside docker, use service_name from a "docker-compose" file instead._

## Code quality

Make sure you read and follow [.NET Quality Criteria](https://github.com/BinaryStudioAcademy/quality-criteria/blob/production/source/dotnet.md).
Also, there are some best practices for frontend development: [Angular](https://angular.io/guide/styleguide) and [Typescript](https://google.github.io/styleguide/tsguide.html)

#### Docker:

1. Make sure you have [Docker](https://www.docker.com) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install).
2. Pull this repo to your machine.
3. You can build and run all application containers via `docker-compose -f docker-compose.apps.yml up -d` command.
4. You can pull and run all 3rd-party services (MSSQL Server, RabbitMQ) via `docker-compose -f docker-compose.services.yml up -d` command.
5. Happy coding! :sunglasses:

#### Setup environment for local development:

1. Download and install [.NET 6 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download).
2. It might be usefull to have EF CLI. Install via command: _dotnet tool install --global dotnet-ef_
3. Download and install LTS version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
4. Install Angular-CLI via: _npm install -g @angular/cli_. _[What is Angular-CLI?](https://angular.io/cli)_

## Extensions for frontend development (required):

- ESLint (analysis tool that checks TypeScript\JavaScript code for readability, maintainability, and functionality errors)
- EditorConfig (helps maintain consistent coding styles for multiple developers working on the same project)

Some extra extensions which can significantly help to work with Angular:

- Angular Language Service (intelliSense for Angular templates)
- Angular Snippets
- Angular Schematics (working with Angular schematics via UI)

## Environment variables

This is a list of the required environment variables:

#### RabbitMQ

**RABBIT_MQ_USERNAME** - RabbitMQ username

**RABBIT_MQ_PASSWORD** - RabbitMQ user password

#### MSSQL Server

**SA_PASSWORD** - MSSQL Server "SA" user password
